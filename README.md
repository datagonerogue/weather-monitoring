## Introduction

Weather forecasting plays a crucial role in our daily lives, whether it's planning outdoor activities or preparing for potential weather hazards. This project offers a straightforward Python solution to visualize weather forecast data in an interactive and user-friendly manner. The primary objective is to empower users to make informed decisions based on the forecast data.

## Installation

To get started with the weather forecast visualization project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/CTM-Giorno/forecast-visualizer.git
cd forecast-visualizer
```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Obtain a weather data API. (Ex. [OpenWeather APIs.](https://openweathermap.org/api))
## Usage

Once the project is set up and you have acquired the weather forecast data, follow these steps to visualize the weather patterns:

1. Run the main Python script:

```
python api_to_dataframe.py
```

2. The script will prompt you to input the API key and Location for the forcast.
    
3. After processing the data, the interactive plots will be generated using Matplotlib, showcasing the temperatures of the previous weeks.

4. Explore the plots using the provided interactive features, such as zooming, panning, and hover tooltips.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: The project offers interactive plots, allowing users to explore weather forecast data conveniently.

- **Temperature Plot**: Visualize temperature patterns over time, helping users understand temperature fluctuations.

### Upcomimng Features

- **Precipitation Plot**: Understand precipitation levels and patterns with an easy-to-read precipitation plot.

- **Wind Pattern Plot**: The wind pattern plot shows the direction and intensity of the wind, providing insights into weather conditions.

- **Customization**: Users can customize the plots based on their preferences and requirements.
